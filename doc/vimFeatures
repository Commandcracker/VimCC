The stuff below is taken fram a draft i did in the code, don't pay to much 
attention to it

---
 
 command is how the cusor should move, among a few other things
		horiz
		vert
		delEol - delete end of line 'J'

	These can be called with the following keys:
		h, j, k, l
		0, ^, $
		w, W, e, E, b, B
		f, F, t, T
		(, ), {, }, [[, ]], []
 numberMod is how many time the move command should be repeated
 otherMod if anything should be done while moving the cursor
		y, Y
		d, D
		c, C
		x, X
		~

 Please notice that all of these commands can't stack

 Almost no commands wrap around lines

 All commands take a numberMod and a move command unless
 otherwise stated.



 M O V E S
 h, move left
 l, move right
 j, mode down
 k, move up

 ^, move left until start of text
 0, move left until start of line
 $, move right until end of line

 w, move right until start of next word
 W, move right until after next space
 e, move right until end of current word
 E, move right up to the next space 
 b, move left to start of current word
 B, move left until preceeding space

	All these takes one extra argument, to know what to find
 f, move left until cursor is on a selected character
 F, move right until cursor is on a selected character
 t, move left until cunros is on the character before the selected character
 T, move right until cunros is on the character before the selected character

 (, ), ... 	These have to do with jumping sections, 
	but otherwise they work as normal move commands

 O T H E R _ M O D
	Some of these have special cases where their function can differ on things
	not related to move commands. (dd deletes the current line, for example)

 y, copy characters moved over
 Y, copy current line, doesn't take move commands
 d, cut charactors moved over
 D, cut from current column until end of line, doesn't take move commands
 c, like 'd', but enters insert mode afterwards
 D, lide 'D', but enters insert mode afterwards 

 x, delete 'numberMod' characters forwards. Doesn't take move commands
 X, delete 'numberMod' characters backwards. Doesn't take move commands
 ~, change case for upcomming 'numberMod' characters. Doesn't take move commands
