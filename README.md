# VimCC

## Features
### Supported commands
*And how they differ from the real deal*
'W', 'E' & 'B' don't wrap around lines

### Currently unsupported features that would be nice to have
- **Ex commands!**
- ~ (switch case)
- buffers
- undo
- reverse find ('F' & 'T') 
- Repeating insert commands
- . (repeat last change)
- C-u
- C-d

### Currently unsupported features that isn't that important
- R
- 'w', 'e' & 'b', currently only 'W', 'E' & 'B' are supported. With the lower
case variants mapped to the upper case variants
- splits (like the screen is big enough for that...)
- syntax highlighting
- better vimrc
- ';' & ','
- '(', ')', '{', '}', '[[', '[]', ']]', ']['
- '/', '?' (serching)
