# VimCC

## Features
### Supported commands
*And how they differ from the real deal*
`W`, `E` & `B` don`t wrap around lines

### Currently unsupported features that would be nice to have
- **Ex commands!**
- ~ (switch case)
- buffers (at least one)
- undo
- reverse find (`F` & `T`) 
- . (repeat last change)
- C-u
- C-d
- support for commands executed by holding down CTRL and another key
- `w`, `e` & `b`, currently only `W`, `E` & `B` are supported. With the lower

### Currently unsupported features that isn`t that important
- 'R' replace mode
- splits (like the screen is big enough for that...)
- syntax highlighting (but this shouldn`t be to hard)
- better vimrc support
- `;` & `,`
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[[`, `[]`, `]]`, `][`
- `/`, `?` (serching)
- `%` (go to matching bracket)
- Line numbering

## Other
### Features parts of the program that I would like where done differently
If the contents of the file could be stored as one large string instead of many
small strings, then searching the whole file would be easy. Also, `w` and the
like would be able to line wrap
