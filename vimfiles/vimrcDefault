-- DEFAULT VIMRC FILE FOR ccVim.
-- I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST EDITING THIS FILE,
-- SINCE IF THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH IF A VALUE HERE IS
-- MISSING OR INCORRECT.
-- A PERSONAL CONFIG FILE CAN BE CREATED IN '/.vimrc'
-- THAT FILE CAN'T HAVE ANY INCORRECT VALUES, BUT FIELDS
-- NOT NEEDED CAN JUST BE LEFT OUT FROM THAT FILE.
--
-- THIS FILE AND YOUR LOCAL .vimrc IS RUN AS CODE WHEN VIM
-- STARTS, THE VARIABLES SET IS THEN LATER USED IN OTHER
-- PARTS OF THE PROGRAM


--[[ LOG LEVEL
Possible values:
	ALL
	WARNINGS
	NONE
]]--
logLevel = "ALL"

--[[ ESCAPE BUTTON
Possible values:
	anything found in the keys api
	http://www.comuptercraft.info/wiki/Keys_(API)
	But I would recommend against taking a key used for something else...
]]--
escBtn = keys.tab
